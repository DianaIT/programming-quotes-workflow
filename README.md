# Description

this workflow will update your README with a programming quote every day.<br>
static_template should be the original README . <br>
this is a project for the github hackathons on dev.to , my post can be found [here](https://dev.to/elkhatibomar/generate-programming-quotes-in-readme-every-day-2g56)

# How it works?

the script will generate a quote for you then he will create a new README using the static one plus the quote.
***

quote of the day :
I think the best way to make JavaScript better would be to
make it smaller. If we could just get it down to what it does really well and remove the features that add little or no value, itâ€™s actually a better language. -Douglas Crockford
